/1\\ What is Bermuda Triangle? //1\

Bermuda Triangle is a story written by the Wave Ware team.  Actually, the
story is this game so writing is still in progress.  We also plan to create
a 3D version of this game.


/1.1\\ Status
The textadventure supports trigger.  At the moment I create a little game
called 'Story of Lalala' to test the engine.


/2\\ How to start? //2\
Just execute the start script on *nix but I don't have windows support right
now.


/3\\ Ingame //3\
The game is divided into three parts.  There is a textfield where you can
read current activities.  On the right there is a map and on the top status
box.

/3.2\\ Control

If you are a beginner in the *nix world you are probably confused by the
control keys.  Use hjkl to move:

h = left
j = down (J points down)
k = up
l = right

Press m for menu.



Have fun,
Wave Ware
